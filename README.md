# 01-challenge
Weekly challenge for 01-HTML-Git-CSS

## Description

In the 01-Challenge, I took a finished website and replaced some div elements with working semantic elements. This allows the website to be more accessable.

## Usage

After my changes, the updated site should still look as it does in the screenshot.
